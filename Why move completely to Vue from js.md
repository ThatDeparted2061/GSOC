# Why Move JavaScript Logic Files to Vue Files (Composables/Stores)

As part of modernizing and scaling the CircuitVerse simulator using Vue 3, it's important to transfer logic from standalone `.js` files to Vue-style modules like `.vue` components, **composables**, or **Pinia stores**.

Here are the key reasons why this approach is better:

---

## üß† 1. Vue Reactivity System Integration

JavaScript files don‚Äôt automatically benefit from Vue's reactivity system.

‚úÖ By using `ref()`, `reactive()`, and `computed()` in Vue composables, you enable Vue to automatically track and react to state changes.

```js
// Before in plain JS
let simulationRunning = false;

// After in Vue
const simulationRunning = ref(false);
```

---

## ‚ôªÔ∏è 2. Scoped and Modular Logic

Composables help you scope logic to one feature or reuse it across components cleanly.

```js
// composables/useSimulationManager.js
export function useSimulationManager() {
  const running = ref(false);
  function start() { running.value = true; }
  return { running, start };
}
```

‚úÖ This promotes cleaner code, reusability, and better organization.

---

## üîß 3. Improved Maintainability

- Logic within Vue components or composables is easier to read and debug.
- You get full support from Vue DevTools.
- Onboarding new developers becomes easier due to consistent structure.

---

## üí¨ 4. Easier Communication Between Logic and UI

Vue-style logic simplifies event handling and data updates.

```vue
<template>
  <button @click="toggle">Start Simulation</button>
</template>

<script setup>
import { useSimulationManager } from '@/composables/useSimulationManager';
const { toggle } = useSimulationManager();
</script>
```

‚úÖ No need for manually emitting events or referencing global state.

---

## üöÄ 5. Future-Proof Architecture

Placing logic within Vue‚Äôs ecosystem prepares the codebase for:

- Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Desktop app deployment (e.g., Tauri)
- Unit and E2E testing
- Better TypeScript support

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è When You Might Keep `.js` Files

If your JS logic is:

- Pure utility (math, string, formatting helpers)
- Does not require reactivity
- Reused in non-Vue environments (e.g., Node.js backend)

‚Ä¶ then keeping them in `utils/` is fine.

## ‚úÖ Summary

| JS in `.js` files        | JS inside Vue (composables/stores)         |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Static, not reactive     | Reactive with Vue                         |
| Hard to reuse cleanly    | Modular and scoped                        |
| Global spaghetti risk    | Scoped and testable                       |
| No DevTools integration  | Full DevTools/debugging support           |
| Legacy-friendly          | Modern, future-proof Vue 3 architecture   |

> By aligning with Vue 3's Composition API and state management patterns, the codebase becomes more scalable, maintainable, and ready for the future.
